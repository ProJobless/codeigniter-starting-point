All schema files are stored here:

The schemas themselves are stored in schema/ e.g. schema/payments-schema.sql with a schema for every table in the database


Schema data is then stored in the data directory

- Any data which is critical to the application running, e.g. countries, should be saved into data/required in the format countries-schema-and-data.sql.
- Any data which is used for testing the application should be saved in data/sample in the format submissions-schema-and-data.sql
